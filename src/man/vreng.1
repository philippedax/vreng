.SH NAME
vreng \- 3D Virtual Reality ENGine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vreng
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBVREng\fP (Virtual Reality Engine) is a distributed 3D application
allowing navigation in virtual worlds connected over the Internet
using IP Any Source Multicast (ASM) Technology.
The user will benefit more from this experience if connected on the MBone
(IP Multicast Backbone), but if not, he beneficiates of the full-duplex
Reflector Unicast/Multicast (see -R option below).
.PP
See http://www.vreng.enst.fr/.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBvreng\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.BR  " -a, --avatar model"
To force an avatar model (android or box or man or guy).
.\".TP
.\".BR  " -b, --skin  b|g|y|w"

".TP
".BR  " -b, --bbox"
To draw bounding-boxes.
.TP
.BR  " -d, --debug mask"
To validate debugging with a cumulative bit mask position.
A mask is a bit positionned in a 32 bits word. Masks can be
cummulative to trace different features.
.TP
.BR  " -f, --frames rate"
Limits the number of frames per second to 'rate'.
If rate is null or this option has no argument, then
there is no limitation and the application can
use all the power of the CPU and the accelerator card.
.TP
.BR  " -g, --no-gravity"
Starts without gravity.
.TP
.BR  " -h, --help"
To show summary of command line options.
.TP
.BR  " -i, --infogl"
To show current OpenGL infos (GL/GLU versions and extensions).
.TP
.BR  " -k, --keepcache"
Do not keeps in the cache xml description files (*.vre), use http to retrieve these files.
.TP
.BR  " -l, --listcache"
Lists the cache and exit.
.\".TP
.\".BR  " -l, --look old|new"
.\"To choose look and feel between old one and new one.
.TP
.BR  " -n, --number"
Number of simultaneous threads to download textures images.
.TP
.BR  " -p, --pseudo nickname"
To use a pseudo name rather than the login name (default).
.TP
.BR  " -q, --quality"
To involve a better quality when rendering textures,
to activate if a graphic card accelerator is present.
.TP
.BR  " -r, --refresh"
To refresh cached datas.
.TP
.BR  " -s, --silent"
To disable sound effects.
.\".TP
.\".BR  " -t, --theme n|t"

.TP
.BR  " -v, --version"
To show the current vreng's version number.
.TP
.BR  " -w, --world url"

The usual scheme is "http", but it is possible to use the "file" scheme
for testing your own world.
.TP
.BR  " -2, --fullscreen"
To display with a double size window (width x 2, height x 2),
covering almost the full screen, but rendering performances will be slower.
.TP
.BR  " -3, --thirdview"
Use third person view.
.TP
.BR  " -A, --address  group/port/ttl"
To use an explicit IP Multicast Address. Usually irrelevent,

.BR  " -L, --loghttpd"
Logs additionl client infos as version, os, user in the httpd access.log.
.TP
.BR  " -M, --multicast"
To use directly the MBone IP Multicast infrastructure,
opposite to -r,--reflector option.
.TP
.BR  " -N, --nopersist"
Mode fast without persistency, e.g. without MySql or Sqlite or Postgres requests to a server.
.TP
.BR  " -P, --progress"
Shows progression indicators when loading objects.
.TP
.BR  " -Q, --sqltrace table"
To trace the sql UPDATE query on this sql table.
.TP
.BR  " -R, --reflector"
To use the reflector Unicast/Multicast if your host is not on the MBone.
This option is strongly recommended if the case where, either
your host cannot benefit of IP Multicast routing protocols as PIM-SM,
or if your Internet Provider doesn't supply this service.
This option is set by default.
.TP
.BR  " -S, --stats"
Prints statistics when quiting.
.TP
.BR  " -T, --timetolive days"
Cache time to live in the cache (default 3 days).
.TP
